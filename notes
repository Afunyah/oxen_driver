ADD THIS AFTER PULLING SCHEMA
The datastore observe method does not work when an int-like value(eg 5.0) is in a double field for one of the models (eg rating field in RIDER, COMPANY).
After an amplify pull, in the particular model file, in the fromJson method, replace the field assignment ie json['totalEarned'] becomes (json['totalEarned'] as num?)?.toDouble()
